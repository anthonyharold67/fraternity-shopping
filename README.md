# Fraternity Team e-Shopping Project
It is a shopping application prepared for teamwork. Firebase is used for database and login/register operations. Operations such as adding a product to the cart, increasing the quantity of the product in the cart when trying to add the same product, keeping the cart in the database if the user leaves before completing the shopping, and pulling the cart from the database when he logs in again were applied.
